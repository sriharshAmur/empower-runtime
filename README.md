5G-EmPOWER: Artificial Inteligence-empowered Mobile Operating System
====================================================================

### What is 5G-EmPOWER?
5G-EmPOWER is a near Real Time RAN Intelligent Controller (nRT-RIC) designed for heterogeneous wireless/mobile networks.

### QoS Slicing
This repository contains the QoS Slicing application. This is an application that can dynamically create slices and traffic rules. It requires the DSCP Stat element and the Traffic Rules Elemnt running inside the WTP. These 2 elements can be found in the [LVAP-Agent](https://github.com/sriharshAmur/empower-lvap-agent). 

### Top-Level Features
* 5G-EmPOWER supports both LTE and Wi-Fi networks. Support for NR and ns3 is undergoing.
* 5G-EmPOWER provides well defined programming abstraction around mature AI/ML toolkits lowering the entrance barrier for researchers and practioners.
* 5G-EmPOWER provides a REST API and native (Python) API
